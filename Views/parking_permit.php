  <h3>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
  <p>Please read pages 1 and 2 of this packet before you complete the application on page 3.
     You are eligible for a special parking permit or license plates if you are a New York
      State resident who has one or more severe disabilities that impair your mobility.
       For a description of these disabilities see Part 2 of the application on page 3 of
        this packet. A parking permit may be issued for either a permanent or temporary
         disability. Permits are issued in the name of the person with the disability. You
          do not have to be a driver, or the registered owner of a vehicle, to get a parking
           permit. Children of any age who have a severe disability are eligible for permits,
            as are persons who are legally blind.</p>
   <p>1) To apply for the parking permit:</p>
   <p>Fill out Part 1 of the application on page 3. If you have a PERMANENT DISABILITY,
      have a Medical Doctor, Doctor of Osteopathy, Physician Assistant, Nurse Practitioner,
       Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (for disabilities related to the foot) or Optometrist
        (for blindness) fill out the “permanent disability” Medical Certification section
         in Part 2 of the application form and return the form to you. If you have a TEMPORARY
          DISABILITY that requires the use of an assistive device, have a Medical Doctor or
           Doctor of Osteopathy fill out the “temporary disability” Medical Certification
            section in Part 2 of the application form and return the form to you. NOTE:
             If you have a permanent disability, the need for medical certification may be
              waived by the issuing agent if you have an obvious, visually-identifiable
               disability (such as the loss of a leg) OR if you already have license plates
                for persons with severe disabilities.</p>
   <p>You must take your completed application to the appointed issuing agent for the city,
      town, or village where you live. DO NOT SEND YOUR APPLICATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF
       MOTOR VEHICLES (DMV)- DMV DOES NOT ISSUE PARKING PERMITS. If you have a driver license
        or a non-driver ID card that is issued by the NYS DMV, you must show the document to
         the issuing agent. The issuing agent will write on your permit the last three digits
          of the nine-digit number that is printed on your license or non-driver ID card to
           help law enforcement identify the actual permit holder and help limit abuse. YOU
            ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A DRIVER  LICENSE OR NON-DRIVER ID ISSUED BY THE NYS DMV
             IN ORDER TO GET A PERMIT, UNLESS YOU ARE A NEW YORK CITY RESIDENT (a permit will
              not be issued to a New York City resident who does not provide a copy of his or
               her driver license or non- driver ID card with the permit application, as
                described below).</p>
   <p>NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS - The New York City Department of Transportation (NYC DOT)
      issues permits to residents of New York City. If you are a New York City resident
       who needs a permit, you must send your application and a copy of your driver license
        or non-driver ID card to the NYC Department of Transportation, Permits and Customer
         Service, 30-30 Thomson Avenue, 2nd Floor, Long Island City, NY 11101-3045. Call
          (718) 433-3100 for more information. If you do not provide a copy of your driver
           license or non-driver ID card with your application, NYC DOT will not issue a
            permit. If you have plates for persons with severe disabilities, complete Part
             1 and attach a copy of your registration. If you have custom plates for persons
              with severe disabilities, attach a photo of your plate showing the International
               Symbol of Access. Please read important information about “PARKING IN NEW
                YORK CITY” on page 2.</p>
    <p>NASSAU COUNTY RESIDENTS - Call (516) 227-7399 (the Nassau County Office of the Physically Challenged) to find
       out where to apply for a permit.</p>
    <p>ALL OTHER NEW YORK STATE RESIDENTS - Call your local city, town or village hall to find
       out where the nearest agent who issues permits is located. Most city, town or village
        clerks, and some police departments, issue permits. Most agents accept form
         MV-664.1, but some agents have their own application form, and not all agents issue
          permits for temporary disabilities.</p>

    <p>2) To apply for license plates:</p>
    <p>Your disability must be permanent.</p>
    <p>The vehicle on which the special plates will be used must be registered to the person
       with the disability. A person must be at least age 16 to have a vehicle registered
       in his or her name.</p>
    <p>Fill out Part 1 of the application on page 3. A Medical Doctor, Doctor of Osteopathy,
       Physician Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (for disabilities
        related to the foot) or Optometrist (for blindness) must fill out the “Permanent
        Disability” section in Part 2 of the application form and return the form to you.
        NOTE: The need for a medical certification may be waived by the Motor Vehicles office
        if you are permanently disabled and have an obvious, visually-identifiable disability
        (such as the loss of a leg) OR if you have a permanent (blue) parking permit for
        the disabled. Permit holders should bring the permit with them and, also, fill out
        Part 1 of the application and attach a copy of the permit application showing the
        medical certification or doctor’s statement.</p>
    <p>You can get the plates at any Motor Vehicles office. Bring the completed application
      with you.</p>
    <p> - To register your vehicle for the first time, you must provide all of the items
      required for an original registration and include proof of your disability.</p>
    <p> - If you have plates on your car, bring the plates with you to exchange for plates
       for persons with severe disabilities. You must fill out a registration application
       (form MV-82) and pay $25.00 for the new plates that show the International Symbol of
       Access (ISA).</p>
    <p> - If this transaction is done at any time other than when you renew a vehicle registration,
       you will have to pay an additional $3.75 transaction fee.</p>
    <p>Personalized plates with the ISA are available from DMV’s Custom Plates office.
       For information, call (518) 402-4838.</p>
    <h3>USING LICENSE PLATES AND PARKING PERMITS</h3>
    <p>The plates and permits may be used to park in reserved parking spaces only when the
       person with the disability rides in or drives the vehicle. People who are not disabled
        cannot use your parking permit or special plates to park in a reserved space;
         persons who park illegally in these spaces violate Section 1203-c(4) of the NYS
          Vehicle and Traffic Law and can be fined $50 to $75 for a first offense, and
           $75 to $150 for a second offense that is committed within two years.
            Municipalities can impose higher fines. Any person who abuses or misuses any
             parking permit or license plates for the disabled may have the permit or plates
              revoked.</p>
    <p>Parking permits should be hung from the rear-view mirror when the vehicle is parked,
      but should be removed from the mirror when the vehicle is driven.</p>
    <p>Generally, the plates and permits are valid everywhere in New York State where parking
       spaces are reserved for persons with disabilities. However, use of the plates or
        permit does not exempt you from state or local parking regulations or fees or the
         requirement to obtain permission to park in a designated area. The plates and
         permits are also valid in most other states, territories and foreign countries.
         If you will travel outside of New York, check with the police or Motor Vehicles
         agency in the location where you will be to be sure your permit or plate will be
         accepted.</p>
    <p>Parking spaces reserved for people with disabilities must be marked with conspicuous
      and permanently installed above-grade signs that display the wheelchair symbol. These
      signs are positioned at a height of five to seven feet above the parking space surface.
      Designation of reserved spaces may include the use of blue painted lines or markings.
      Do not park in the striped access aisle next to spaces reserved for people with
      disabilities even if you have a permit or plates. Access aisles provide room for
      people with wheelchairs and other specially equipped vehicles to transfer safely to
      and from their vehicles.</p>
    <p>Localities designate parking spaces for persons with disabilities by local law or
      ordinance. If you have a question about parking for the disabled on a particular street,
       contact the authority that maintains the road. If you have a question about reserved
        parking at any facility with off-street parking, contact the facility manager or the
         local building inspector.</p>
    <h3>PARKING IN NEW YORK CITY</h3>
    <p>New York City (NYC) does not reserve spaces on its streets solely for persons with
      disabilities. However, the City does issue a City permit (a rectangular dashboard
      permit) that allows a person with severe disabilities to park at City curbside
      spaces that are not available to most vehicles, or at legal metered spaces without
      charge. This permit is not valid outside of New York City. You can have a City permit
       and a New York State permit, which are issued by the NYC DOT.</p>
    <p>Throughout New York State and in New York City, reserved parking spaces are available
       in parking lots for shopping centers, malls, office buildings, apartment buildings,
        and college campuses. You can use the special plates or the State permit to park
         in designated spaces in those off-street lots.</p>
    <p>For more information or to get a permit application, you can visit the NYC DOT website
       at www.nyc.gov/dot or call (718) 433-3100. You may also contact the NYC DOT at:</p>
    <p>NYC Department of Transportation </br> Permits and Customer Service </br> 30-30
     Thomson Avenue, 2nd Floor </br> Long Island City, NY 11101-3045</p>
    <h3>METERED PARKING WAIVERS</h3>
    <p>If you have a mobility-related disability and a certain severe disability that limits
       your ability to access or put payment into a parking meter, you may be eligible
       for a metered parking waiver. The metered parking waiver allows the holder to park
        in a metered parking space in any city, town or village of New York State (except
        in New York City) without paying the fee. For more information, see forms MV-664.1MP
        (Application for a Metered Parking Waiver for Persons with Severe Disabilities)
        and MV-664.2MP (Metered Parking Waiver Information). These forms are available
        through your local issuing agent and are also available on the DMV website at
        dmv.ny.gov.</p>
